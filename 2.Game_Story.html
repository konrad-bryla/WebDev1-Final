		<p> 
		Long ago, the Gods of Brylithia banded together in order to create a champion of the cosmos and as a result they gave life to the land of Brylithia in its own pocket of time and space as a training ground. The gods have created the Trials of Bryla which the inhabitants of Brylithia would have to uncover and take part in to become champions. Although, overjoyed and anxious for the first champion to be crowned. For thousands of years attempt after attempt, the very existence of the trials began to be whisked away by every breeze. The ancient ruins of civilizations buried under rock, forest, and disguised by nature not a soul could find even a spec of the trials.
		</p>
		<p> With the Gods unable to gain a champion they grow old, and tired. Their need for a champion derived from the increase of other worldly invaders called neighbors.  These neighbors became a formidable foe whose armyâ€™s grew by each attack. Dark Gates would fill the sky and neighbors would flood out to conquest. The Gods of Brylithia could no longer defend their home and they fled to Brylithia. With all magic and energy expended they lay dormant scattered across the land. And having the trials they so desperately needed to survive locked away behind the lost tongues they may have no hop in ever regaining their forms and will forever lay dormant. </p>
